                <h1>Joey</h1>
                <p>Joey is an application I worked on with Liam Madigan. It's centered around creating personalized 
                        content that's relevant to a user's morning routine - something that's easily scannable 
                        and processed in the time it takes to finish a cup of coffee.</p>

                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>Because this was an interaction based on apple tv, the interactions had to be very quick 
                    and able to be navigated through with a remote which was especially challenging. We decided to make 
                    it fun and personalized with our little coffee cup character to help the user get their day started with 
                    a smile on their face.
