                <p>Traditional DMV Forms are tedious and inconvenient. In an effort

                    <h2>Solace</h2>
                    <p>This semester, I spent 12 weeks researching how to make the medical experience 
                        more informative and personalized to it's patients, and their families. My solution is 
                        an application called Solace that is meant to help the user educate themselves and manage their 
                        own treatment.

                    <p>Over the summer, I worked to create a branding animation for Willowtree, Inc. The result 
                        was a thirty second animation illustrating their mission statement "The freedom to

                    <p>Joey is an application I worked on with Liam Madigan. It's centered around creating personalized 
                        content that's relevant to a user's morning routine - something that's easily scannable 
                        and processed in the time it takes to finish a cup of coffee.
