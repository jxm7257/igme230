               <h2>Audience</h2>
               <p>Internship Recruiters - Based on experience interacting with internship recruiters, I know they
                    typically look for some sort of project process. They want to know what the
                    problem was, how you went about obtaining a solution, and what you learned
                    and decided along the way. To make this site successful to them, I need to
                    show the finished product as well as how I got there. They also would be
                    interested in my professional history and education experience, so a resume
                    would be helpful.
               </p>
   
               <p>Professors - Based on things professors have said in the past, they like to see a lot of things
                    similar to recruiters. They are also interested in learning a bit about me,
                    whether that be as a student or just an individual. What do I do with my time
                    outside of classes? What are my hobbies? Am I involved in anything else?
                    They may not be as concerned with a resume, but they definitely are still
                    interested in seeing my work.
               </p>

               <p>Based on what I’m looking for from other peoples’ portfolios, peers would
                    typically be looking for my projects, and how I present them. Underclassmen
                    would be looking for my solutions to the projects they’re doing in class, and
                    they want to know what I did to get to that point.</p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <img src = "images/home-page.jpg" alt = "home page sketch">
                <img src = "images/project-page.jpg" alt = "project page sketch">
                <p>I've attached my sketches above which outline my two column grid approach to desktop. When 
                    choosing design elements, I chose colors that I thought were engaging and reflected my personality.
                    The type face I wanted to be bold and modern, but still clean, and the photos for the projects 
                    were meant to give a little preview of what the project was but not give the whole thing away just yet.
                    I wanted them to be a little window into the project, but not the whole thing.
                </p>

                <h2>Resources</h2>
                <p>I coded all of this myself except for the hamburger menu. I followed a tutorial to help me get
                    the functionality working , but then changed the visual elements. I changed colors, size of the text 
                    added hover and transition functionality, and changed the background of the menu to fit differently 
                    in the viewport. Other than that I just used two google web fonts called Montserrat and Open sans. The 
                    menu tutorial can be found here: https://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/cms/creating-a-hamburger-menu-with-html-css-and-jquery.html.
                </p>

                <h2>Other</h2>
                <p>I used a lot of knowledge from my design classes regarding what users want to see from a website,
                    visual affordances, and user interface design patterns. I definitely expanded my knowledge of jQuery 
                    because on the last project I couldn't get the menu working, so the tutorial definitely helped!
