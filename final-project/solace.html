                <h1>Solace</h1>
                <p>This semester, I spent 12 weeks researching how to make the medical experience 
                        more informative and personalized to it's patients, and their families. My solution is 
                        an application called Solace that is meant to help the user educate themselves and manage their 
                        own treatment.</p>

                <h2>My Approach</h2>
                <p>I centered my design around a user that had just been diagnosed and was using this applicaiton 
                    to help feel more prepared. It would sync with their account all patients are given when they 
                    are in a hospital, so new perscriptions and suggestions appointments would auto-populate. 
                    That way, the user can just focus on getting better.
