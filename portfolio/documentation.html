            <h3>My Process</h3>
            <p>I did not use a framework, however I did use a
                css reset from Meyers which I credit in my code, and the Google web font Montserrat. 
                In terms of what I struggled with, I was playing a lot with the mobile hamburger menu 
                but was having trouble getting it to work. I found a codepen tutorial that helped me, but 
                for some reason in my code I had an error I couldn't quite figure out. This is definitely something 
                I want to continue working toward, but I definitely want to turn this first version in on time for the project deadline.
                I am continuing to do more research to hopefully get the full menu up and running soon! I also have never done a print media
                query so I'm not positive if that is correct, but I learned a lot while reading about it.
            </p>
