            <h1><span>DMV Form</span></h1>
            <p>Nobody enjoys going to the DMV. It's unfriendly, stuck in the past, and overall an experience that everyone dreads. 
                This vehicle registration form redesign was meant to take an out-of-date form and bring it into the modern tech world. 
                Focusing on making the entire experience more enjoyable and humanistic, I had to rethink how the form would be responsive to user-input. 
                Thus, simplifying the experience as a whole.

            <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>In my wireframes I tried to keep a simple and clean approach, I
                    explored a single column layout to ensure the user wouldn't be 
                    overwhelmed by demanding input fields. Below you can see my
                visal comps.</p>
